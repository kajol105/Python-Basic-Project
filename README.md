# Looping 
#### A looping is an instruction that repeats multiple times as long as some conditions are met.There are three types of looping statements in python.
1. for loop :
for loop is one of the following statements in python that is used to iterate over a sequence of elements. This sequence can be list,tuple,string or any other object that can be iterated.

2. while loop:
The while loo is another looping statements in python that are used to repeat a block of code untile a certain condition is met.

3. nested loop:
Nested loop is a loop within the another loop. It is used when we want we want to iterate over a sequence of elements contain multiple levels of nestin

### Loop Control Statements
#### Lpop control statements are used to alter the normal flow of the looping statements in python. There are three types of loop control statements in python which are break, continue and pass
1. Break statement:
  The break statement is used to terminate the loop in prematurely in python. It is used when we want to exit the loop before it has completed all of its iterations.
2. Continue statement:
  The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop. It is used when we want to skip a certain element in the sequence and continue with the next iteration of the loop.
3. Pass statement:
  The pass statement is used as a placeholder in python. It is used when we want to wrtite empty code blocks and want to come back and fill the in later

#  String Indexing
### Strings are ordered sequences of character data. Indexing allows us to access individual characters in a string directly by using a numeric value. String indexing is zero-based: the first charachter in the string has index 0, the next is 1 ans so on.

# List Operations
### Python is a collection of things,enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas. List are the simplest containers that are an integral part of the python language. List need not to be homogenous always which makes it powerful tool in python. A single list may contain DataTypes like integers, Strings as well as objects. List are mutable,and hence they can be altered even after their creation.

# Dictionary
## Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered,changeable and do not allow duplicates. Dictionaries are written with curly brackets. Dictionaries are changeable because we can add, remove iteams after the dictionary has been created.

# Tuple
## Python tuple are a type of data structure that is very similar to lists. The main difference between the two is that tuples are immutable,meaning they can not be changed.

# UDF: Arguments and Parameters

### A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produce output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function. Functions that readily come with Python are called built-in functions. Python provides built-in functions like print(), etc. but we can also create your own functions. These functions are known as user defines functions
### Python User-defined functions
All the functions that are written by any of us come under the category of user-defined functions. Below are the steps for writing user-defined functions in Python.

In Python, a def keyword is used to declare user-defined functions. 
An indented block of statements follows the function name and arguments which contains the body of the function. 
### Python Parameterized Function
The function may take arguments(s) also called parameters as input within the opening and closing parentheses, just after the function name followed by a colon.
